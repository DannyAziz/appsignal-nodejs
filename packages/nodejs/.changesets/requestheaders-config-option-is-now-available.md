The `requestHeaders` config option is now available. An allow list that gives the ability to define
which request headers you want to be shown in sample detail views. The default is a list of common
headers that do not include [personal identifiable information](https://docs.appsignal.com/appsignal/gdpr.html#allowed-request-headers-only).
Read more about [request headers](https://docs.appsignal.com/application/header-filtering.html) on our documentation website.
