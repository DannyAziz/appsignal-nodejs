  filename.
- [baa2b7f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/baa2b7fb46aaa42a0e7d953276df3965968f733f) patch - Limit the `appsignal.log` file size in diagnose report. It will only send the last 2MiB of the file. This prevents the diagnose report from sending too much data that it gets rejected by the server.

- [58e73ba](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/58e73ba815d31dbf5f25e74d50eb843b112fc3de) patch - Replace the `--no-report` option--which turned sending the diagnose report
  to AppSignal's servers off--with `--send-report` and `--no-send-report`.
  
  By default, the report is not sent if you don't pass `--send-report`.
