# AppSignal for Node.js Changelog

## 2.2.1

- [98f11a0](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/98f11a0685f05676669ded7fa852536c59991e80) patch - The diagnose report will report parsing errors on reading or parsing the installation report. Previously, a missing installation report file would crash the diagnose tool.
- [e4215a1](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/e4215a119849a709fc44f8b5d1d2b96ea0e1a269) patch - Print String values in the diagnose report surrounded by quotes. Makes it more clear that it's a String value and not a label we print.
- [d0a05ae](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/d0a05ae9bcaeef6d4443e53952920774821aeb5c) patch - Correct the diagnose host section indenting, it was indented one level too far to the right when printed.

## 2.2.0

- [9c8319e](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/9c8319e7d014882b9d4fe609ac49e3918f4e0259) minor - Remove interface usage from @appsignal/types
  
  All Node.js-specific interfaces from the types package are now defined
  inside the nodejs core package. There's still a dependency from types
  package for common types as Func, HashMap, and HasMapValue.
  
  With this change, we keep taking advantage of interfaces, but now they're
  defined in a place where they're used.

## 2.1.1

- [42edcc0](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/42edcc06b9258cc30ea13008d1f7ebc39332e28d) patch - Show correct language version in diagnose's extension installation section. It did not show the language version used during install, but the current one used to run the diagnose tool.
- [99b2f6c](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/99b2f6cd6ca743d42c59587a05e979efe080797a) patch - Rename the `Agent` module to `Extension` to fit better with our naming standards.
- [ad6be4f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/ad6be4f38a6caff7fdfa06ae1d1ef51145bc004d) patch - Fix diagnose installation status reporting. It previously always reported "success", but will now also print failures.
- patch - Update @appsignal/nodejs-ext dependency to 2.0.2.

## 2.1.0

- [723b98d](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/723b98d1370cb74d3d0198f4c7d49d08691095c2) minor - Add rootSpan and setError helpers.
  
  Errors added to child spans are ignored by the agent. Now the rootSpan is
  always accessible from the tracer object as well as setError. The setError
  function allows to track errors on demand and they will be always attached
  to the main current span, so they don't get ignored by the agent.
- [f0256d3](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/f0256d3979fef129ded0644e712efbb96036967a) patch - Bug fix in custom timestamp calculation
- [1f182a4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/1f182a49548322b8af8ecec59ca5efe85cbebc29) patch - Deprecate the addError function on the Span interface. Instead use the Tracer's `setError` function to set the error on the root span.
- [96df8a4](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/96df8a43d7e9061233ac9ff9e5f2dde3c8d83ff7) patch - Add sendError helper to Tracer object.
  
  This new helper allows you to track an error separately from any other span
  inside the current context. Or use it to set up in your own error handling to
  report errors in a catch-statement if no performance monitoring is needed.
  
  ```js
  try {
    // Do complex stuff
  } catch (error) {
    appsignal.tracer().sendError(error, span => {
      span.setName("daily.task"); // Set a recognizable action name
      span.set("user_id", user_id); // Set custom tags
    });
  }
  ```

  filename.
- [baa2b7f](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/baa2b7fb46aaa42a0e7d953276df3965968f733f) patch - Limit the `appsignal.log` file size in diagnose report. It will only send the last 2MiB of the file. This prevents the diagnose report from sending too much data that it gets rejected by the server.
- [7bb5398](https://github.com/appsignal/appsignal-nodejs/commit/7bb5398af34a46038b52fede68c5746df9db71e0) patch - Fix the validation of Push API key in the diagnose report. It would always print "valid" even if the key was not set or invalid.

  to AppSignal's servers off--with `--send-report` and `--no-send-report`.
  
  By default, the report is not sent if you don't pass `--send-report`.
